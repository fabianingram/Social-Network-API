# Social-Network-API


## Description 
The Social Network API is an app which will focus on MongoDB, Mongoose and Express for testing server routes. With the MVC, you can create users, as well as have thoughts on users posts, and react to thoughts. The user will be able to update and delete users and thoughts. Insomnia Core will help visualize testing routes as well as making requests to the server. There will also be virtuals as to friend counts and reaction counts.
